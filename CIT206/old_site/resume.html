                <br />
                I was employed by General Electric because of my   technical expertise and past experiences supporting a sales department. My   duties were to support Account Representatives in the selling of high speed   analog modems to fortune 500 companies in the Pacific Northwest. Other duties   were to renew leases and maintenances contracts on OEM Data Communication   manufactured equipment to Boeing Computer Services by telephone. I also assisted   the Account Representatives process their lease contract orders. Boeing Computer   Services became the Division’s largest client after my first year in this   position and I was credited by the Regional Management for exceeding my   projected goals. With that and many more accomplishments I was promoted after   two years from Inside Sale Support to an Account Representative. In my duties in   outside sales I was responsible for new lease and maintenance contracts on OEM   high speed data communication equipment to Boeing Computer Services,   Weyerhaeuser, Seafirst Banks and Nordstrom. Through my hard work and an   innovative approach to find solutions for my clients the GE office in Kent   Washington was number one in sales for 3 consecutive years between 1981 and   1984. </td>
